# Saudi-Arabia-Real-Estate-Sales-Analysis

I analyzed real estate sales data for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using Power BI.
This data was gathered from the Saudi Open Data website.

During this analysis, several important and useful insights were uncovered, including:

- Total Sales: amounting to 1.72 trillion Saudi Riyals.
- Number of Units Sold: reaching approximately 2 million residential units, including land plots, villas, and apartments.
- Total Deals: reaching 33,000 transactions.

It was noted that the majority of sales and transactions occurred in the Riyadh and Makkah regions. Among the types of properties, residential land plots were the most sold, followed by agricultural land.

The data also revealed that the year 2021 recorded the highest total sales, reaching 0.43 trillion Saudi Riyals, while the year 2022 witnessed the highest number of transactions, totaling 7.8 thousand.
